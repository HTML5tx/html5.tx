Behind the contact form is a complete suite of online tools to effectively manage all of your leads, contacts, tasks, appointments, and more. As leads come in from your contact form, those contacts are automatically added to your online contacts database in your free ContactMe.com account.   From there, you can not only access your form submissions and contacts, but you can fully track, organize, and manage your communications by taking notes on the contact, creating a to-do list grouping and categorizing your contacts, and much more.

= What is the ContactMe button? =
The ContactMe button is a gorgeous shiny button that sits on the side of your blog and maintains position even as your visitors scroll so your contact form is always one click away! When someone clicks the button, your contact form pops right up in a beautiful window, darkening the rest of the screen and focusing the user on completing your contact form. The ContactMe button and contact form has been proven again and again to improve conversions on a website.

= In addition to a great contact form, do you offer other unique features? =
Absolutely! ContactMe goes way beyond a simple contact form plugin. Setup auto-responders for your contact form, add a captcha to prevent spam, get contact form submissions via SMS, encourage users to follow and tweet you with a custom success message, and more! We also have reports so you can track your contact form performance over time. ContactMe also offers a full suite of contact management tools so that you can actually manage the leads that come in through your contact form.
